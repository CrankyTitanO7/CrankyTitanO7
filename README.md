- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrankyTitanO7
- 👀 I’m interested in WEEZER
- 🌱 I’m currently learning why my pip is broken again, and I can't for the life of me install tensorflow-text.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my extensive DE BELLUM GALLICUM library and my Catullus-cicero-cataline gay love triangle.
- 📫 How to reach me please don't, but I guess follow me on insta
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm actually not pro-noun, I prefer verbs, but I guess some nouns like serendipity and petrichor are cool.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not Italian.
